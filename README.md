# HomeworkHelp

## Inspiration

The Idea behind HomeworkHelp is to build a web application that will help students to solve Math questions with better understanding. As many students hesitate to ask questions in class, they can use this application to get help. This application will help students to learn and understand the concept better.

## What it does

- Students can upload their Math questions in the form of images or text.
- The application uses OCR to convert the image to text.
- Then the text is sent to the ML model to get the answer.
- Once the answer is received, it is sent to the user in form of step by step solution.

## How we built it
- We used ReactJS for the front end.
- We are using OCR to convert the image to text.
- We are using CNN to train the model to get the answer.

## Challenges we ran into
- Implementing the OCR was tough.
- Getting the model to work was also tough.
- It was hard for me to work on the styling part.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Building a full stack app.
- Building a web app to help the students.
- Helping the students to learn better.

## What we have learned
- I learned how to create a full-stack app.
- I learn to use OCR.

## What's next for HomeworkHelp
- Improve the accuracy of the model.
- Add more features to the app.
